- plot_figures.py: Generates heatmaps, tsnes, correlation graphs and volcano plots found in the manuscript

- CV_analysis.py: Visualizes coefficients of variation in cerebral cortex

- EMD_analysis.py: Visualizes EMD between marker's expression from the same and different clusters

- pseudo_bulk_analysis_ctx.py: Visualizes pseudo bulk analysis in prefrontal cortex

- pseudo_bulk_analysis_hipp.py: Visualizes pseudo bulk analysis in hippocampus

- params_visu.py: Parameters to generate figures
